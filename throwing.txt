Everything that is made on the potter's wheel starts out as a cylinder, so that is what will be tought first. When throwing there are six steps:
  Coning
  Centering
  Opening 
  Pulling 
  Forming

Here is what is going on with each step.
Starting off cut a piece of clay that feels comfortable in your hand. Try to keep it under two pounds, anything over two pound can become difficult to move around on the wheel when first starting off.
